# Currency Converter Application

## Overview

This project is a web-based Java application, written using the Spring Boot framework, that provides a RESTful service for currency conversion. The service takes three parameters: the amount, the currency of the amount, and the target currency. It returns the converted amount using up-to-date exchange rates fetched from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) API. The application is written using the Spring Boot framework and is hosted in the cloud using AWS.

## Features

- REST API for converting currency amounts.
- Currency exchange rates are fetched from the NBP API and cached to improve performance and reduce the number of requests.
